# Personalized Insulin Dosage Prediction Using Hybrid LSTM-GRU Model

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting personalized regular insulin dosages for diabetic patients using a hybrid deep learning model combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layers. Leveraging the **AIM94 diabetes management dataset**, the model utilizes temporal glucose readings, food intake, and physiological event data to capture individual patterns in insulin requirements. Through comprehensive preprocessing and time-sequence modeling, the system aims to assist in personalized diabetes care by providing accurate insulin dose recommendations.

## 🔑 Key Highlights

- **Hybrid LSTM-GRU Architecture**: Integrates both LSTM and GRU layers to effectively capture short- and long-term dependencies in patient glucose-insulin dynamics.
- **Raw Data Preprocessing**: Transforms the raw AIM94 event-based logs into a usable time-series format by pivoting codes, encoding time features cyclically, and generating lagged variables.
- **Time Window Sequence Modeling**: Generates input sequences using a sliding window approach to feed multivariate time-series data into the model.
- **Clinical Impact**: Aims to provide a data-driven support system for insulin dose planning, improving glycemic control and reducing the risk of hypo/hyperglycemia in real-world scenarios.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict regular insulin dosages using historical glucose readings, food intake, and physiological events with high precision.
- Capture temporal patterns in diabetes management using hybrid recurrent architectures.
- Preprocess raw medical records into meaningful temporal sequences for modeling.
- Contribute toward building personalized decision-support tools in diabetic care.

## 🧪 Preprocessing Pipeline

To convert the raw AIM94 event-based logs into a model-ready time-series dataset, we performed the following steps:

- **Data Cleaning**: Removed irrelevant codes, handled missing values, and standardized date-time formats.
- **Event Pivoting**: Transformed event codes into structured columns like:
  - Glucose
  - Insulin types (Regular, NPH, UltraLente)
  - Food Intake
  - Hypoglycemia
  - Exercise
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Cyclic encoding for time-of-day (sine/cosine of Hour and Minute)
  - Lag features for past glucose and insulin values
  - Temporal indicators (e.g., morning/afternoon/evening)
  - Binary event flags for food, exercise, symptoms
- **Sequence Generation**: Created multivariate input sequences using a sliding window to forecast the next insulin dose.
- **Normalization**: Applied Min-Max scaling to continuous features for better model convergence.

### 🔁 Raw to Processed Data Example

To help understand the transformation, below is a visual comparison of how raw event-based logs are transformed into structured time-series records for modeling.

These transformations were key to structuring the input sequences used by the hybrid LSTM-GRU model.

## 🔭 Future Work

- **Multi-output Prediction**: Extend to predict other insulin types (e.g., NPH, UltraLente).
- **Attention Mechanism**: Introduce Transformer or attention layers for better interpretability and performance.
- **Cross-Dataset Testing**: Validate the model on other real-world diabetes datasets.
- **Deployment**: Package the solution into a web app using Flask or Django for clinical testing and real-world usability.
